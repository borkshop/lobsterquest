Windows
-------

### Building it yourself (best)

Pre-Requirements: VS2019 Community edition or better, C++ desktop tools installed.

Get https://github.com/aardappel/lobster using your favorite git tool (best), or just download
a `.zip` from there otherwise.

Open `dev\lobster\lobster.sln`, ensure `Release` is selected in the top bar,
`Build -> Build Solution`, then close if no errors.

### Alternatively: getting latest pre-built

If you don't want to deal with building it yourself, you may be able to use
a pre-built executable, though these can be out of date.

On https://github.com/aardappel/lobster/releases, for the last release that has a
`lobster_<date>_windows.zip` also get `Source code (zip)` (this has all the data files
and examples). Unpack both, and place the exe you find in the first inside the top
`bin` dir you find in the second.

### Running it

You now have a `bin\lobster.exe`. You can run this with any Lobster file
as argument to run it, for example `bin\lobster.exe samples\pythtree.lobster`
should work.

OS X
----

### Building it yourself (best)

Pre-Requirements: Latest XCode.

Get https://github.com/aardappel/lobster using your favorite git tool (best), or just download
a `.zip` otherwise.

Open `dev/xcode/lobster/lobster.xcodeproj`, ensure `lobster_release > My Mac` is selected
as scheme in the top bar, `Product -> Build`, then close if no errors.

### Alternatively: getting latest pre-built

If you don't want to deal with building it yourself, you may be able to use
a pre-built executable, though these can be out of date.

On https://github.com/aardappel/lobster/releases, for the last release that has a
`lobster_<date>_osx.zip` also get `Source code (zip)` (this has all the data files
and examples). Unpack both, and place the executable you find in the first inside the top
`bin` dir you find in the second.

### Running it

You now have a `bin/lobster` executable. You can run this with any Lobster file
as argument to run it, for example `bin/lobster samples/pythtree.lobster`
