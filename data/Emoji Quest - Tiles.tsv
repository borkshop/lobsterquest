# euia	⚅									Euia is the nice side of the world. It is forested and has six mountains, in two ranges, along the northern and southern fringes. There is a castle in the middle, forests to the west and a fluvial plain to the east. The player begins their journey in the forest and must find their way to the north and to the west.									
apple tree/hardwood	🌳	1	1							Apple trees bear apples, introducing the player to the health mechanic. The apples restore one empty health container.	483		1	483	0	0	0		
pine tree/softwood	🌲	1	1							Pine trees exist only in the high mountains. The player must have one stamina and three hearts to reach them from the outset. They produce *pine apples* (natch), which restore two hearts of health instead of one. If the player only has one heart container, the pine apple gives them their second, extending their range of travel deeper into the mountains.  Pine trees can also be cut for their softwood lumber. This is materially necessary to build a canoe, granting access to Occia and the quest for the Essence of Water.	372		1	372	0	0	0		
pear tree/hardwood	🌳	1	1							The pear tree is unique and exists only in the forest due west of Castle Euia. The pear tree drops pears, which are necessary to extend the player’s stamina so they can travel over mountainous terrain and survive. This allows the player to find *a flat miner* and obtain a *pick axe*.	1		4	1	0	0	0		
clover	☘️									Clover exist on the plains to the east of Castle Euia. They become useful in the quest for Occia, where it transpires that they can be gilded to make a fleur de lis, and then reshaped to make a trident. This enables the player to restore Herman the Merman and gain the Essence of Water. This in turn is one of the two requirements to be granted access to the naughty side of the world.	1		0	1	1	0	0		
ewe/sheep	🐑	1	1		2	grass			ram/sheep	Sheep, in general, provide wool which is material necessary for creating coats, which in turn give access to the north face of the world.  Sheep may in turn produce mutton if they are killed with a sword or worse. Meat can extend the health bar to three heart containers.	1		3	1	0	0	0		
ram/sheep	🐏	1	1		2	grass				Rams, however rare, can drop horns. These do not yet figure into any designed quests but will likely be useful for all kinds of horn related crafting, especially the restoration of mojical creatures that require horns, and the creation of mojical instruments, as well as the post office horn and post offices.	1		3	1	0	0	0

castle	🏰			1						Castle Euia is the seat of Princess Dice, who provides the exposition for the broadest quest arc: restoring mojick. Her lieutenants, the guards provide more tangible advice for the early quest arcs to get access to the north and south.	1		6	1	0	0	0		
euia bank/bank	🏦			1						Once the player has obtained precious medals in the mountains, they need the bank to get the right denominations for various kinds of metal crafts at the forge. The bannk and forge are therefore close together.  The bank also foreshadows the quest of Dysia, where the player will need to get a loan so they can fuel a rocket and seek the Essences of Power and Fire in the heavens.	1		5	1	0	0	0		
euia forge/forge	🏭			1						The forge is a crafting site for changing precious medals into parts the player can use to make all the various kinds of tools.	1		5	1	0	0	0

mountain	⛰	10								Mountains produce copper. The player may encounter other kinds of mountains for higher denominations of precious medals later in the game, but for now they must trade copper up at the bank to get exact medals necessary for crafting various components at the forge.	77		0	77	1	0	0
